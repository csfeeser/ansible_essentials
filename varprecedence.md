There are three things we can be sure of in life: death, taxes, and that smurfs are BLUE.

Take this tiny playbook. Define a variable named `smurfs` in each one. HOWEVER, make each value of `smurfs` a **different color!**

```
- hosts: bender
  gather_facts: no

  vars:

  vars_files:

  vars_prompt:

  tasks:
```
